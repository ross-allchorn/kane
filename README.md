## Ode to a Programmer ##

A programmer is a *weaver of digital tapestries*;<br>
Crafting intricate patterns with logic and precision. 

They must possess the *mind of a philosopher*;<br>
Questioning assumptions and seeking elegant solutions; 

The *heart of an artist*, finding beauty in the abstract; <br>
And the spirit of a scientist. 

Ever curious and eager to explore new frontiers. <br>
With humility, they acknowledge the infinite expanse of knowledge;

Striving to learn *ceaselessly*. 

And above all, they should *build with empathy.*<br>
Considering the impact of their creations on the world, 


For code is not merely syntax, <br>
**But a vessel for human interaction and progress**.

â€“ Ross Allchorn
